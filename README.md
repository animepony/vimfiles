# Vimfiles

This project is my Vim/Neovim setup. I've been using Vim for a long time and
this repo contains all tweaks and settings that I learned over time.

This setup is tested on macOS and Linux with both Vim and Neovim.

## Requirements

It works with Vim >= 7.4 or Neovim on macOS and Linux, but I think it should
work in other environments.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your home directory:

    git clone https://github.com/lenon/vimfiles.git ~/vimfiles

Then execute the installation script:

    cd ~/vimfiles
    ~/vimfiles/scripts/install.sh

Start `vim` and enjoy! :beer: :sunglasses:
