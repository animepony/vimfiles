# Vimfiles

These are my Vim files. I created them over the time to suit my needs, so don't
expect lots and lots of useless stuff here. :smile:

work on other environments without problems.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your home directory:

    git clone git://github.com/lenon/vimfiles.git ~/vimfiles

Go to the cloned repo and then update submodules:

    cd ~/vimfiles
    git submodule update --init

Link `vimrc` for command-line Vim and `gvimrc` for MacVim:

    ln -s ~/vimfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/vimfiles/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

Install all plugins using Vundle.vim (it is normal to see some warnings here):

    vim +PluginInstall +qall

Start `vim` and enjoy! :beer:
